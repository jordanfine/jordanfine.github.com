My name is Jordan Fine. I’m currently going into my fourth year at the University of Florida, studying Digital Arts &amp; Sciences Engineering with a minor in Mass Communications. </p><p>Beyond my engineering curriculum, you’ll find me designing marketing materials for Reitz Union Board Entertainment. As Lead Marketing Designer, I create fliers and videos for the student run entertainment board that plans free events 7 days a week. Check us out! </p><p>When I’m not fiddling around with Illustrator and coding, I like to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and a movie. Around Gainesville, you’ll find me searching for that perfect slice of pizza, hanging out at cafes, catching a show at the Atlantic or enjoying a new, arthouse film at the Hippodrome Theatre.</p><p>After college, I hope to build off my experiences and passions as a Front End Developer in the tech industry.</p><p>I'd love to chat!</p></div></div></div></section><section id="portfolio"><div class="l-portfolio"><div class="wrapper"><div class="l-portfolio--title"><h1>Portfolio</h1></div><!--TODO - CLEAN UP AND EDIT COPY--><div class="l-portfolio--media"><div class="l-portfolio--right"><h1> <span>Gather</span></h1><p>Gather is an online marketplace for casual and professional event planners alike to discover, vet and book hundreds of restaurants & event venues for large group events & private dining. At Gather, I came in at the beginning of the design process of the marketplace application. Over the summer, I worked along the CTO and CEO to build out the marketplace from mockup to prototype to shipment. We built the app using Node.JS, Express, AngularJS, Jade, Stylus, Coffeescript, to name the few. Beyond front-end development, I helped shape the design of Gather Marketplace by creating mockups, illustrations, email templates, and redesigns for the existing restaurant software. In October, I have now returned to Gather to continue my work on the marketplace. </p><a href="http://www.gatherhere.com" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary">Visit Gather</a></div><div class="l-portfolio--rightimage"><div class="image"><img src="public/img/gather-transaction.png"></div></div></div><div class="l-portfolio--media"><div class="l-portfolio--leftimage"><div class="image"><img src="public/img/mapflix.png"></div></div><div class="l-portfolio--left"><h1> <span>MapFlix</span></h1><p>MapFlix was the semester long project from a Human Computer Interaction course. Throughout the semester we had to find a problem, interview potential clients of the proposed application, conduct focus groups, build the application, and run a pilot test study. After all the data was collected, we wrote user evaluations and analysed the data. MapFlix is an application to help foreign film enthusiasts browse for films based off location using geographical visualization (Google Maps) versus the existing method used in Netflix. Though MapFlix wasn’t favored over Netflix, most users were moderately satisfied with the experience of Netflix, which gives room for designers to experiment with Netflix’s UX. The application was built using Google Maps and Freebase API. </p><a href="http://www.hellopug.com/netflix" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary">Visit MapFlix</a><a href="public/files/jordanfine.ppt" target="_top" class="btn btn--secondary">View Final Presentation</a></div></div><div class="l-portfolio--media"><div class="l-portfolio--right"><h1> <span>Clue</span></h1><p>Clue was a final project for Interactive Modeling &amp; Animation. During this course, we were exposed to the language, Processing, often called the programming language for Artists. Throughout the semester we created little pieces dealing with motion, shapes, color, and physics-motion. I designed the scenes, weapons, and characters using Photoshop. 							</p><a href="https://github.com/jordanfine/clue" target="_top" class="btn btn--primary">View on Github</a><a href="public/files/manual.pdf" target="_top" class="btn btn--secondary">View User Manual</a></div><div class="l-portfolio--rightimage"><div class="image"><img src="public/img/clue.png"></div></div></div><div class="l-portfolio--media"><div class="l-portfolio--leftimage"><div class="image"><img src="public/img/da.png"></div></div><div class="l-portfolio--left"><h1> <span>Damage Assessment Portal</span></h1><p>The Damage Assessment Portal is an application for UF Admin to report any physical damages to their facilities during traumatic events. The purpose of the application is for the University of Florida to have a record of all damages for FEMA or any other government agencies that would need record of these damages. Other features in the application is to view all the damages on a map. For example, if a tornado went across the north side of campus, we could visualize the damages and overlay it with the tornado's path. Before coding the application, I designed the UI in Photoshop. We built this application using PHP, Javascript, and Twitter Bootstrap. </p></div></div><div class="l-portfolio--media"><div class="l-portfolio--right"><h1> <span>Fruitvale Station</span></h1><p>This flyer was designed for RUB Entertainment’s November Indie film, to be distributed across downtown Gainesville and on-campus. The idea behind designing this flyer was to display a minimal representation of the BART rail system. After visiting the Bay Area over the summer and seeing the film, I was fascinated by the simplicity of the rails. I feel the simplicity of these rails juxtaposing the chaotic city reflects on the events that happened in Fruitvale Station, a simple man trying to make his life better amongst the chaos of his past life. I’ll try not to spoil the movie, go see it! </p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/rubentertainment" target="_top" class="btn btn--primary">Follow RUB Entertainment</a></div><div class="l-portfolio--rightimage"><div class="image"><img src="public/img/fruitvale.png"></div></div></div><div class="l-portfolio--media"><div class="l-portfolio--center"><h1>RUB Promotional Video Montage</h1><p>Back in 2012, I set out to modify and change the dynamics of the graphic design operation of RUB Entertainment. Over my four years in RUB, I’ve helped evolve the branding and marketing for the organization. Starting my freshman year, I joined the Promotions committee, which later became Special Events committee. On Special Events, I was the main graphic designer for the committee, creating flyers for our monthly events. I noticed a major issue, each committee had it’s own graphic designer creating completely different designs and nothing was consistent. Starting in 2012, I became Director of the Arts committee, planning gallery openings and art related events, such as bringing Anthony Rapp, from the broadway musical Rent. As Director of the Arts Committee, I formed a group of designers to handle all the graphics for the organization. When the year ended, we realized that the work was too much to handle for a director who must also plan events. That is how the Marketing Designer position on the Executive board was created. Working closely with the Vice President of Marketing, we have a more cohesive brand and communication with the director’s planning events. Over the course of my last year, I am planning on creating a branding guide for the organization to leave behind when I graduate.</p><p>This video is an example of an idea I brought to the organization. This video plays before every film at the Reitz Union Cinema and through online social-media during the month of September. </p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/37PSX0UCOUM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div></div></section><section id="resume"><div class="l-resume"><div class="wrapper"><div class="l-resume--title-bar"><div class="l-resume--title"><h1>R&eacute;sum&eacute; </h1></div><div class="l-resume--download"><a href="public/files/resume_jordanfine.pdf" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary"><i class="icon-download"> </i>Download</a></div></div><div class="l-resume--column"><div class="l-resume--education"><h1>Education</h1><h4><span class="major">BS in Computer Science Engineering </span><br><span class="focus">with a focus in Digital Arts &amp; Sciences  </span><br><span class="minor">Minor in Mass Communications</span><br>	University of Florida | Gainesville, FL<br>	2010 - Present</h4></div><div class="l-resume--tech"><h1>Tech &amp; Product Experience</h1><h4><span class="company">Gather </span><span class="location">- Atlanta, GA</span><br><span class="job">Front End Web Developer &amp; Designer</span><br>	May 2013 - August 2013, October 2013 - Present</h4><h4><span class="company">TapShield </span><span class="location">- Gainesville, FL</span><br><span class="job">Front End Web Developer</span><br>	August 2013 - October 2013</h4><h4><span class="company">Department of Facilites Planning &amp; Construction </span><span class="location">- Gainesville, FL</span><br><span class="job">Web Developer &amp; Designer</span><br>	November 2012 - May 2013</h4><h4><span class="company">SpareFoot</span><span class="location">- Austin, TX</span><br><span class="job">Web Developer &amp; Designer</span><br>	May 2012 - August 2012</h4></div><div class="l-resume--design"><h1>Design Experience</h1><h4><span>Lead Marketing Designer</span><br>	RUB Entertainment | Gainesville, FL<br>	May 2013 - Present</h4><h4><span>Graphic Designer for Special Events Committee</span><br>	RUB Entertainment | Gainesville, FL<br>	August 2011 - May 2012</h4></div></div><div class="l-resume--column"><div class="l-resume--leadership"><h1>Leadership Experience</h1><h4><span>Director of Arts Committee</span><br>	RUB Entertainment | Gainesville, FL<br>	May 2012 - May 2013</h4><h4><span>Residential Counselor </span><br>	Duke TIP Summer Studies Program | Boone, NC<br>	June 2011 - August 2011</h4></div><div class="l-resume--skills"><h1>Skills</h1><h3>Languages &amp; Tools</h3><p>HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/Coffeescript, jQuery, AngularJs, Jade/HAML, Stylus/LESS/SASS, Grunt, RequireJS, Java, Git, MATLAB, Processing, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux</p><h3>UX &amp; Design</h3><p>Balsamiq Wireframes, Pilot Testing, User Studies, Interface Design, User Research, Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, InDesign, Premiere Pro, Maya</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Trumpet, Event Planning, Social Media, Digital &amp; Film Photography
